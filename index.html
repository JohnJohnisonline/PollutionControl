						<p>Stormwater runoff is water that flows over the land surface during precipitation events (such as rain or snow). As it flows, it can pick up pollutants from the land, such as chemicals, sediment, and debris. When stormwater runoff enters water bodies, such as rivers, streams, and lakes, it can cause pollution and degradation of the water quality.

							There are several sources of pollutants in stormwater runoff, including agricultural and urban runoff. Agricultural runoff can contain pesticides and fertilizers, while urban runoff can contain motor oil, heavy metals, and other pollutants from roadways and other human activities.
	
							Stormwater runoff pollution is a serious problem, as it can harm aquatic life and make water unsafe for human use. It can also impact the overall health of the ecosystem and reduce the aesthetic value of the water body. To address this problem, many cities and municipalities have implemented stormwater management programs to reduce the amount of pollution entering water bodies from stormwater runoff..</p>

									<p>1. Emission controls are devices or systems that are used to reduce the amount of pollutants released into the air. These can include catalytic converters on vehicles, scrubbers on industrial smokestacks, and filters on power plant stacks.

										<h2><a href="#">Process changes:</a></h2>

									<p>2. Making changes to the way a process is carried out can also help to reduce pollution. For example, changing from a solvent-based manufacturing process to a water-based process can reduce the amount of hazardous waste produced.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Substitution:</a></h2>

									<p>3. Substituting a less toxic substance for a more toxic one can also help to reduce pollution. For example, using a biodegradable cleaning agent instead of a harsh chemical can help to reduce the amount of pollution entering water bodies.</p>

									<p>4. Reducing the amount of waste produced can also help to control pollution. This can be done through recycling, reusing materials, and reducing the amount of packaging used.</p>

									<p>5. Pollution can also be controlled by treating it after it has been released into the environment. This can be done through techniques such as sewage treatment, oil spill cleanup, and landfills.</p>
